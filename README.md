A two-wheeled, self-balancing alarm clock that physically moves away when the alarm rings. The alarm can only be silenced by catching the robot. Built as part of ECE 453: Embedded Systems Design at UW-Madison.

## Features

- Self-balancing robot built on the PSoC 6 microcontroller
- IMU-based PID control for balancing
- Time-of-Flight sensor for obstacle detection and avoidance
- Real-time clock for alarm scheduling
- Bluetooth LE connection to a desktop GUI for setting time and alarms
- LCD display for live time output
- Custom PCB, 3D-printed chassis, and fully integrated hardware system
