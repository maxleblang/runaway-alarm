# Runaway Alarm Clock
PSoC 6 Self-Balancing Alarm Robot

A two-wheeled, self-balancing alarm clock that physically moves away when the alarm rings. The alarm can only be silenced by catching the robot. Built as part of ECE 453: Embedded Systems Design at UW–Madison.

## Features

- Self-balancing robot built on the PSoC 6 microcontroller
- IMU-based PID control for balancing
